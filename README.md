Credit Card Churn Prediction

Overview

Thera Bank has recently experienced a significant decline in its credit card user base. Given the importance of credit cards as a revenue stream—through various fees such as annual fees, balance transfer fees, cash advance fees, late payment fees, and foreign transaction fees—the bank is keen on understanding the factors leading to customer attrition.

This project aims to develop a classification model that predicts which credit card users are likely to leave their services. By analyzing customer data and identifying key attributes influencing churn, the bank can implement targeted strategies to enhance customer retention and mitigate potential losses.

Objectives

Analyze Customer Data: Investigate customer profiles, transaction history, and account details to uncover patterns associated with churn.

Build Predictive Models: Create and evaluate machine learning models to predict customer churn based on historical data.

Optimize Model Performance: Apply hyperparameter tuning and other optimization techniques to enhance model accuracy and robustness.

Provide Insights: Generate actionable insights and recommendations to help Thera Bank improve its services and retain customers.

Key Features

Data Exploration and Visualization: Explore the dataset, visualize key features, and understand customer behavior.

Feature Engineering: Process and engineer features to improve model performance.

Model Development: Implement various classification algorithms, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting, to predict churn.

Performance Evaluation: Use metrics such as confusion matrices, ROC curves, and F1 scores to evaluate model performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune models to achieve optimal performance.
